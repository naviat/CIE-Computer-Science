# Programming syllabus walk-throughs
I made two [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks that guide you through most of the Python programming topics. I try my best to
* cover fundamental areas that textbooks don't discuss adequately
* offer an alternate explanation, than those presented by most courses or textbooks
* talk generally about topics, so as to develop transferable skills
* prompt you to research and explore on your own
* provide silly examples.

The notebooks are also available using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), which can run in a web browser, so you don't have to install any software to view them. Binder is one of the recommended platforms for Jupyter notebooks.

These notebooks were originally designed for the [CIE 9608 Computer Science](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-computer-science-9608/) syllabus. However, they have been updated to cover the following CIE syllabuses:
* IGCSE 0478
* IGCSE 0984
* AS & A Level 9608
* AS & A Level 9618

Having said that, please do read and follow your syllabus specifications—there are some topics I choose not to cover because textbooks already do a good job there. I suspect these notebooks cover other syllabuses or exam boards too, but again—match against the syllabus specifications.

**Note:** Like all things in technology, Python is frequently updated. Sometimes, these changes result in syntax changes, such as mandatory parenthesis in `print()` from Python 2 to Python 3. It's possible that my work is out of date from the most recent Python version. I'll try to update it when I can, but you can see my last updated version below.


Current version: Python 3.8.8
